    "insight": "- Both FIIs and DIIs were net buyers, suggesting positive sentiment in the market.\n- DII buying was significantly higher than FII buying, potentially indicating increased domestic confidence or government support.\n- The net positive institutional flows are likely to provide upward momentum to the market in the short term.\n- Institutional activity may continue to be positive contingent on macroeconomic stability and corporate earnings.\n- Retail investors should carefully consider sector-specific opportunities identified by institutional buying trends.\n- This substantial net buying diverges from previous patterns, indicating a possible shift in institutional allocation towards Indian equities.\n- Investors should monitor global cues, currency fluctuations, and upcoming earnings releases for indications of continued institutional interest."

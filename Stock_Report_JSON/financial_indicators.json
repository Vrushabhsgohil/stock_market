      "value": "- Major US indices (Dow, Nasdaq, S&P 500) and Nikkei are up, indicating positive sentiment in equity markets.\n- Declining crude oil prices (WTI & Brent) suggest potential easing of inflationary pressures, but may also signal weakening global demand.\n- The USD/INR increase signals a weaker Rupee, which could negatively impact import-dependent sectors in India.\n- Rising 10-year Treasury yield indicates increasing investor expectations of inflation or economic growth, potentially impacting bond valuations.\n- Equity markets are likely to be positively influenced by the rise in major indices, but investors should remain cautious due to the declining oil prices and weaker INR.\n- Investors should monitor upcoming economic data releases and central bank communications for confirmation of sustained growth and inflation trends.",

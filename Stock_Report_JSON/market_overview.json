  "insights": "The Indian market exhibited a significantly negative sentiment today, evidenced by substantial declines across major indices. NIFTY 50 and SENSEX both experienced considerable drops of -1.78% and -1.61% respectively, indicating broad-based selling pressure. Banking sector faced significant pressure, with Bank Nifty falling by -1.92%, contributing to the overall downturn, while the Nifty IT index relatively outperformed with a minimal decline of -0.2%. The Nifty Midcap 50 experienced the sharpest correction among the indices with a decrease of -2.38%, suggesting heightened risk aversion towards mid-sized companies. The broad-based selling could be attributed to profit-taking after recent gains and potentially influenced by global market cues or domestic economic concerns. Given today's performance, a cautious outlook is warranted, with potential for continued volatility in the near term."
